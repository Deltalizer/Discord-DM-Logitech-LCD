# Discord-DM-Logitech-LCD
Allows you to display your Discord direct messages onto your Logitech G15 v1, G15 v2, G13 and G510/510S keyboard.

## Setup:

1. Firstly, download the latest release from here https://github.com/Deltalizer/Discord-DM-Logitech-LCD/releases and extract it to a folder. 

1. Open token.cfg in a text editor of your choice. Here you need to paste your discord user token, which can be found by logging into discord in your browser then copying it from your cookies. A super quick tutorial on how to do this can be found here; https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial

1. Once you've pasted the token in, save and close the file then run LogitechLCD.exe.

Please note, this does not currently support the Logitech G19/G19s, that uses a bigger colour display that I don't have access to the hardware to develop for at the moment.

## Usage:

Run the program and wait for it to connect, once it's displayed on the screen you can press the second screen button to view the available channels, press it again to navigate the list. Simply navigate to the chat you want, then press the first screen button to go back to the channel view.

## Possible maybe future features:

* Storing which channel you last had open and reopening to that channel
* View server messages using third function button
* Current voice chat if any displayed on fourth function button
